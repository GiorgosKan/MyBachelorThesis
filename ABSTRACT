This thesis focused on the development of a mobile application aimed at enhancing the
visitor experience in museums by digitizing exhibit information. The primary goal of the
application was to facilitate visitor interaction with the museum by providing immediate
access to exhibit information through QR code scanning and the use of GPS for museum
location identification. The implementation of the application followed a methodology
that combined the use of modern technologies for mobile application development, with
an emphasis on user-friendliness and ease of navigation, making it accessible even to
individuals with limited technological experience. Programming techniques were applied
to enable the instant provision of information, while also ensuring the applicationâ€™s capacity for future expansion, allowing the addition of new features.
The final outcome ofthe project was successful, with the application fully meeting the initial requirements set
out at the beginning of the work. Although the application is complete, it has the potential
for future expansions, such as the addition of more interactive features and the incorporation of advanced security measures. 
By implementing these improvements, the application could offer even greater value to both visitors and museums, making it a significant
tool for the promotion and digitization of cultural heritage.
